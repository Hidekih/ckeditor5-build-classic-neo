## Quick start

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Build de editor:
```bash
npm run build
```

Your build is now available on:
```bash
./build/ckeditor.js
```

**Note:** If you are planning to integrate CKEditor 5 deep into your application, it is actually more convenient and recommended to install and import the source modules directly (like it happens in `ckeditor.js`).
